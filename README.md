# My Personal Project

## Vacation Planner: Escapate
My application *Escapate* is a travel app that will be designed to help travellers
around the world organize their trips in a easy way  This application lets the user 
input trip details like: a packing list, method of arriving to destination, destination, 
expense tracker, dates (start and end), budget, accommodation, attractions, and restaurants for their destination. This app is intended for 
any type of user. From families going on vacations, to a couple or backpackers. Since
the whole purpose of this app is to make travelling much more organized and easy to
follow through, it will be useful for every kind of traveller that wants an ejoyable, 
and stress-free trip. It caters to people that value efficiency and clarity. *Escapate*
offers the opportunity to have a clear interface with an all-in-one experience instead
of having to use several apps to see their flight number, or their budget and expense control. 

This project is of my interest because since I was little my family and I have traveled a lot, 
and every time we did, my mom always plans the trip through different applications and platforms 
which works to some extent. Because of this use of various applications, she was always stressed 
because there was never one place where all the travel information was available. This is why I 
always wanted to create an easy solution for this and that is creating an app with everything available within itself.
Furthermore, *Escapate* aligns with the growing trend of travel enthusiasts seeking digital solutions 
to streamline their travel plans, and I find the prospect of creating a practical and enjoyable 
tool for other travelers quite exciting and fulfilling.
